# Predicting-Credit-Defaults
To assist this institution in quantifying the risk of loan non-repayment, five supervised machine learning techniques were employed, each of which output a probability of default for an individual with certain other known characteristics. Information such as an individualâ€™s marital status, age, previous bill and payment amounts, balance limit, and education level achieved were all considered as potential predictors for these models. For every model, 10-fold cross validation was employed to give an estimate of the misclassification rate.
